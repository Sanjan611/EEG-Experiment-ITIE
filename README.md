# EEG-Experiment-ITIE

## Overview
This EEG experiment aims to study the brain dynamics during visual search and object identification from a signal processing perspective. Tools used - MATLAB, MATLAB toolboxes, EEGLAB, Psychophysics Toolbox

The subjects were presented with the image of a single object, which they had to find in another image containing various objects. The EEG data recorded was analysed in MATLAB using the Psychophysics-3 Toolbox.
The goal of this project was to learn more about neuroscience experiments from a signal processing perspective, as well as try out some deep neural networks to classify the processed data. It gave me a chance to develop a stimuli presentation and interact with subjects as well as work through suggested neuro experiment literature online. Finally, I got to try my hand at writing a research project report.
